Title: sum trigger work log

Goal: characterize the sum trigger board

All the data are stored in the Data.xml file contained in this folder.

Day 07.01.2010

Working Channels: 5,6,7,0,1

Noise of the probe: 7.42 mV
Noise of the scope: 300 Î¼V

Task: Measure the overall gain

To perform this task i'm creating 3 sets of measures:

1) For one channel (channel 5) measure the gain of the amplifier for several amplitudes and one width
2) For one channel (channel 5) measure the gain of the amplifier for one amplitude and two different widths
3) For every channel measure the gain of the amplifier for one amplitude and one width

Measure 1) data are contained in /Overall gain/Channel 5/One width
Measure 2) data are contained in /Overall gain/Channel 5/One amplitude
Measure 3) data are contained in /Overall gain/All channels


Different nominal amplitude used: 100,200,300,400,500 mV

I've found out that the maximum nominal value i can input without causing the saturation of the test board amplifiers is 1100 mV that produces an inverted signal of 1892.7 mV +/- 11.6

For the study on the attenuator i'm setting the attenuator value of every other channel then 5 at 2000 mV, low clipping at 0 mV and high clipping 2000 mV.
The nominal amplitudes taken are from 100 to 1100 mV at steps of 100 mV.

Number of measurements taken with the probe (the input) every time is ~500.
Number of measurements taken with the scope (the output) evety time is ~150.

Clipping measures:

Channel 5

Clipping values : from 100 to 2100 at steps of 200

Nominal amplitudes: 500 and 1100 mV
Actual amplitudes at the input of the board: 960.1 mV +/- 10.9/sqrt(200) , 1.9126 V +/- 14.1/sqrt(200)

Setting the clipping at 100mV the waveform is barely a square wave so the measure of the width is not so accurate.

Measured delay between input and output with 960 mV input and no clipping: 9.63 ns
Measured delay between input and output with 1900 mV input and no clipping: 9.35 ns

NOTE: Substitute Int_t graphPoints with Long64_t graphPoints in every file.
